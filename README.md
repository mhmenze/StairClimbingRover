# StairClimbingRover
This is a stair-climbing rover that has a self-stabilizing platform. This prototype demonstrates how to build a Robot that could help with tasks like moving things up or down stairs. One important feature in this project is that only one microcontroller was used to handle both these tasks simultaneously. The ESP32 Development board was used since it has a dual core processor, and both these cores were utilized separately as shown:

Core 1 - Control the rover using a Bluetooth app

Core 2 - Stabilize the platform base.

MPU6050 Gyroscope sensor was used to get readings for self-balancing, and specially designed wheels were 3D printed for Stair Climbing Mechanism.This is a stair-climbing rover that has a self-stabilizing platform.
